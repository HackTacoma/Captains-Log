# Captains-Log :rocket:
My Before and After action report on each Project

In this repo there are going to be reports on each project/hackathon. Each project will have its own folder where all the reports pertaining to that particular project will reside. The following are some of the things I will be reporting on:

* things I thought I did right
* mistakes I made
* lessons learned
* my thoughts on how I think things went
* some insights I have discovered (aha moments :bulb:)
* random tangents
* advice for future Kevia and others
* anything and everything I think that needs to be documented
* what can I do to improve
