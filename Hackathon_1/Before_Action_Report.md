#:clock12: 00:00

Ok so we are about 24 hours away from the hackathon. In 6 hours it will be 06:00, add another 6 and we are sitting at 12:00. Half the day has passed. This is why we use military time. 

It really helps you to visualize a concept like a day

:sunrise::sunrise_over_mountains::city_sunset::stars: 


into something concrete like an array

```swift
let day: [Int] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
```

You see how 17:00 "feels" later than 05:00

Alright so I have 24 of these boxes or compartments of time to do stuff. Sleep, exercise, read, code, plan stuff, do things I've been putting off, errands, time with friends and family. I can't do them all so some things have high priority and low priority. I have to allocate my 24 boxes of time very carefully before this hackathon. Things below a certain threshold get tossed out immediately. So no :no_good::see_no_evil::beers::tada::video_game:


Things must have a priority level of 8 and above to receive any resources (time).

So I need 6 hours of sleep, 1 hour of excercise and down the line from highest to lowest

```swift
  let sleep: Double = (24 * 0.25) // 6 compartments
  let excercise: Double = (24 * 0.04166666667 // 1 hour; I think; approximate)
  let researchApi: Double = (24 * 0.25) // about 4 - 6 compartments
  ...
```

###Orientation
We had an orientation last week and everything went pretty well. The only thing that sticks out at me is that we spent a little too much on plastic silverware. Went to Costco and bought way more than we needed. **:zap:ADVICE** Before you throw any kind of event or meeting at a venue, look around and see if you can score some free plastic forks, spoons, plates, napkins and much more. You have to remember that you are not the first event, meetup or whatever at the venue. So that means some group before you probably left behind a whole bunch of that kind of stuff. Just ask politely and look in the cabinets and drawers, most the time they really don't care, you are actually helping them by getting rid of that stuff :clap:.
