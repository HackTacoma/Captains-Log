Ok so we are about 24 hours away from the hackathon. In 6 hours it will be 06:00, add another 6 and we are sitting at 12:00. Half the day has passed. This is why we use military time. 

It really helps you to visualize a concept like a day

:sunrise::sunrise_over_mountains::city_sunset::stars: 


into something concrete like an array

```swift
let day: [Int] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
```

You see how 17:00 "feels" later than 05:00

Alright so I have 24 of these boxes or compartments of time to do stuff. Sleep, exercise, read, code, plan stuff, do things I've been putting off, errands, time with friends and family. I can't do them all so some things have high priority and low priority. I have to allocate my 24 boxes of time very carefully before this hackathon. Things below a certain threshold get tossed out immediately. So no :no_good::see_no_evil::beers::tada::video_game:


Things must have a priority level of 8 and above to receive any resources (time).

So I need 6 hours of sleep, 1 hour of excercise and down the line from highest to lowest

```swift
  let sleep: Double = (24 * 0.25) // 6 compartments
  let excercise: Double = (24 * 0.04166666667 // 1 hour; I think; approximate)
  let researchApi: Double = (24 * 0.25) // about 4 - 6 compartments
  ...
```

###Orientation
We had an orientation last week and everything went pretty well. The only thing that sticks out at me is that we spent a little too much on plastic silverware. Went to Costco and bought way more than we needed. 

**:zap:ADVICE** 
```swift
 Before you throw any kind of event or meeting at a venue 
 recon the venue and see if you can score some free stuff
```

There are almost always free plastic forks, spoons, plates, napkins and much more. You have to remember that you are not the first event, meetup or whatever at the venue. So that means some group before you probably left behind a whole bunch of that kind of stuff. Just ask politely and look in the cabinets and drawers, 99% of the time the staff really don't care, you are actually helping them by getting rid of that stuff :clap:.

###Digital IQ
So there was or is a big push in the media saying that everyone should learn how to code. I don't know how I feel about that. I'm not saying thats right or wrong but coding, programming, developing... takes an acquired taste, its not for everyone. You have to actually like it. I think the people who want to program and have an interest in it should, everyone else needs to just learn how SHIT works. 

**:bulb:AHA**  
```swift
 I think we just have to raise digital literacy up
 teach people how all these gadgets work
 make them aware of events like hackathons
 show them that coding is not really scary or esoteric
```

Wifi is just radio waves, that image you are looking at on your phone is just a bag of bits, instructions to your phone telling it where to lay each pixel on the screen:iphone:. I think if we peel some of the mystery and magic behind some the gadgets we use, people won't be so enamored by the gadget itself, but rather by the technology that drives it. Think about all the discoveries and advances in science some really smart people had to make in order for the internet, computers, tablets, smartphones to exist. From Ada Lovelace, Gordon Moore, Brian Fox, Michael Fraday, John von Neumann, Dennis Ritchie, Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Joy, cat vidoes:smile_cat:, the list goes on.    


#:clock8: 20:00

We are now 4 hours away from starting the hackathon. At this point I am just hoping that most the people who said they will make it do show up. One developer came down all the way from Seattle, thanks Wale for coming early. We are in the conference room right now spec and planning out how we are going to build this thing. Its all tentative of course. Alright so one mistake I did make is the fact that I spread myself out too thin. For example I was hitting the streets promoting this event and also doing research on the APIs and technology stacks we were going to use. I did 2 things poorly instead of doing 1 thing right, I tried to be promoter and developer. I should have tried to hire someone else to promote or asked a friend to look up the apis and stack. 


**:zap:ADVICE**
```swift
Do 1 thing right instead of trying to do many things poorly. 
```
