#Power of A Minute :hourglass:

I had to take a full day to let everything sort of soak in. Looking back the hackathon went by so fast. When you are up for so long, and fatigue starts to creep in, something weird starts to happen to your perception of time. It makes you understand and appreciate the power of a minute. You can get so much done in just 1 minute. It's hard to explain. When you are able to focus intently on your work and on mission critical goals, time seems to slow down and expand for you. So 1 hour feels like 3 hours. There were many times when I looked up and said to myself, “Wow, it's only 15:00, we have a lot to go, but look at how much we have done”. There were also times where we would send people to research an API or problem we were having and they would come back in 30 minutes with answers and solutions. 30 minutes:exclamation: Can you believe that. Just 30 minutes, that’s it. So this hackathon really made me appreciate how much work can get done in a very little amount of time.

#Everyone is a Genius :mortar_board:

It is very important that people are in a position where they can express their genius. So here is an example. Mia was apart of the cooking team. So she doesn’t feel like she is smart or have a genius ability because she doesn’t know how to code. But what she doesn't realize is that what she did during that 24 hour hackathon was amazing. See, Mia is able to take a budget, look at how many people she has to cook for and is able to figure out what she needs to get and how much of it she needs in her head. It’s like she has a natural “Feeling” for it. Her and the cooking team created a plan and executed it to the tee. They fed a group of 12 for 24 hours. How is that not genius? I wouldn’t be able to do that. The problem with me is I have no idea how much stuff cost. I would do horrible on the Price is Right, but Mia would do incredible on that show. So that is what I mean, I am able to code and build iOS apps and organize a group, that is my genius. Would I be able to budget and time meals for a group of people, and make it taste good, no way. Oh and by the way these meals weren’t like top ramen or simple stuff. These meals were full on 3 course meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner and snacks in between. If you want to know the meal plan, go to the Ships Log in this repo to see the [Menu](https://github.com/HackTacoma/Ships-Log/blob/master/Hackathon_1/Menu.md). What I learned, especially for someone in a leadership role is you have to understand the dynamics of your team. You have to know each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Then you have to put them in positions and situations where they can express their genius. When a team member is able to express their own genius they will put in 110% because they are doing what they are good at. When you are doing something you are good at, you do it with no effort, it's easy and enjoyable. When every member of your team is able to enjoy what they are doing you have a well oiled machine ready to accomplish things.
