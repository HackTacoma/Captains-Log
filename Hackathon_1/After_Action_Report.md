#Power of A Minute :hourglass:

I had to take a full day to let everything sort of soak in. Looking back the hackathon went by so fast. When you are up for so long, and fatigue starts to creep in, something weird starts to happen to your perception of time. It makes you understand and appreciate the power of a minute. You can get so much done in just 1 minute. It's hard to explain. When you are able to focus intently on your work and on mission critical goals, time seems to slow down and expand for you. So 1 hour feels like 3 hours. There were many times when I looked up and said to myself, “Wow, it's only 15:00, we have a lot to go, but look at how much we have done”. There were also times where we would send people to research an API or problem we were having and they would come back in 30 minutes with answers and solutions. 30 minutes:exclamation: Can you believe that. Just 30 minutes, that’s it. So this hackathon really made me appreciate how much work can get done in a very little amount of time.

#Everyone is a Genius :mortar_board:

It is very important that people are in a position where they can express their genius. So here is an example. Mia was apart of the cooking team. So she doesn’t feel like she is smart or have a genius ability because she doesn’t know how to code. But what she doesn't realize is that what she did during that 24 hour hackathon was amazing. See, Mia is able to take a budget, look at how many people she has to cook for and is able to figure out what she needs to get and how much of it she needs in her head. It’s like she has a natural “Feeling” for it. Her and the cooking team created a plan and executed it to the tee. They fed a group of 12 for 24 hours. How is that not genius? I wouldn’t be able to do that. The problem with me is I have no idea how much stuff cost. I would do horrible on the Price is Right, but Mia would do incredible on that show. So that is what I mean, I am able to code and build iOS apps and organize a group, that is my genius. Would I be able to budget and time meals for a group of people, and make it taste good, no way. Oh and by the way these meals weren’t like top ramen or simple stuff. These meals were full on 3 course meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner and snacks in between. If you want to know the meal plan, go to the Ships Log in this repo to see the [Menu](https://github.com/HackTacoma/Ships-Log/blob/master/Hackathon_1/Menu.md). What I learned, especially for someone in a leadership role is you have to understand the dynamics of your team. You have to know each individual's strengths and weaknesses. Then you have to put them in positions and situations where they can express their genius. When a team member is able to express their own genius they will put in 110% because they are doing what they are good at. When you are doing something you are good at, you do it with no effort, it's easy and enjoyable. When every member of your team is able to enjoy what they are doing you have a well oiled machine ready to accomplish things.   

#Homeostasis vs Resistance

When I was going around talking about HackTacoma I felt like I was fighting Homeostasis rather than Resistance. What I mean is that most people didn’t try to stop me but it was hard to get people moving. I think most people are not comfortable joining something new and unknown. So when you start an organization or have an idea, not everyone is going to be crazy about it and join you. Other people can’t envision what you have in your head. Now, it’s your job to put that vision in their heads and get them excited about it, but in the beginning that is going to be very difficult. So, you are going to get shrugged off by a lot of people. Understand that they are busy too and again they don’t see what you see. At first I was a little hurt when people didn’t email me back or didn’t give me as much help as I needed. Its like "hey I have this really cool idea, help me god dammit". If a person you contact says something along the lines of talk to so and so or I will pass you down to HR, something like that, hang up and move on, that person doesn't care. You have to learn how to just move on because remember you don't have a lot of time. But before you move on take note of the people that helped you in your early stage, and the people who played you (brushed you off). Take care of those people that helped you in the beginning, everybody else after that is just rank and file. Pay very close attention to the people who played you because they will be back when they hear about your success. Now you don’t have to say I told you so or remind them that you tried to get their help before. You know and they most likely know that you did, so now use that to your advantage, you have the upper hand at that point. They are going to try to smile and shake your hand and be all friendly, take it with a grain of salt and keep them close.    

# Why did I do it?

You ever heard the saying it takes a village to raise a child. Well I think this is true for adults too, it takes a village to help a person be successful. Too often do we overlook the importance of a person’s environment when it comes to success. When someone is successful we give too much credit to that individual's traits and skills. On the other hand when someone is considered a failure we are too quick to judge that person’s ability. We don’t stop to think maybe that person just didn’t have the resources or oppurtunities to become successful. Many people tell me that I ‘am a great developer and I know so much (little do they know I have so much more to go), but if it wasn’t for a small [company](http://www.hipstercreative.com) in Tacoma that gave me a chance who knows where I would be now. I may have fallen through the cracks and never have become the developer I am today. What I am saying is that we as a community have to take some responsibility to see that our people go on to be successful. Wether it is the military or college graduates we have to provide ways they can gain the experience and training they need to go on and get jobs or at least some way to earn some side income during their job hunt. We give people the boot too quickly. It's like ok you are out the military or you graduated…....good luck.

HackTacoma was started because I saw a gap. A weird conundrum between what companies wanted and what was being provided in the community. We are all aware of this conundrum, it's where a company wants a minimum level of skills and experience and you don’t have that skill or experience. But then how are you supposed to get that skill and experience if no one will fuc**** hire you? One of my goals for HackTacoma is to find out what companies want and then train and give people the hands on training they need using this hackathon model. This is the stuff you can only learn on the job or from other experienced developers. It’s kind of like working under a Jedi Master if you are a pawdan, just in the developer sense.
