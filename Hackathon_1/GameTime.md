#GameTime
This will be my report as the day progresses. I will break up the day into 4 acts.

```swift
Act I = 00:00 - 05:59
Act II = 06:00 - 11:59
Act II = 12:00 - 17:59
Act IV = 18:00 - 23:59
```

At the end of each act I will write a report summarizing that part of the day.

#ACT I
##00:00 - 05:59

So far pretty good. Teams are making steady progress. I was really impressed by Athena and Darius. They set up their own web server with minimal help. That's a big deal, now they have to install a backend frame work and they are golden. The cooking team is serving up some breakfast right now and everyone seem to be having fun while learning a whole bunch. I am in a good spot as far as the iOS side goes and I should be finished by mid day.
