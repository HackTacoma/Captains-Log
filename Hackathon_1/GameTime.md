#GameTime
This will be my report as the day progresses. I will break up the day into 4 acts.

```swift
Act I = 00:00 - 05:59
Act II = 06:00 - 11:59
Act II = 12:00 - 17:59
Act IV = 18:00 - 23:59
```

At the end of each act I will write a report summarizing that part of the day.

#ACT I
##00:00 - 05:59

So far pretty good. Teams are making steady progress. I was really impressed by Athena and Darius. They set up their own web server with minimal help. That's a big deal, now they have to install a backend frame work and they are golden. The cooking team is serving up some breakfast right now and everyone seem to be having fun while learning a whole bunch. I am in a good spot as far as the iOS side goes and I should be finished by mid day.

```swift
Let people struggle for a while
if they persist they will learn alot
good job guys...and girls
```

#ACT II
##06:00 - 11:59

I can't lie, I am beat. I had to take a quick nap and catch my second wind. Have you ever tried to think while you are running on no sleep and lots of caffeine? The code just started to not make any sense.

**:zap:**ADVICE

```swift
Don't try to power through
Be smart and take regular breaks
```

Most the team seam pretty beat too lol. But this is what it's all about. No one is quitting. You know, how often do you put yourself through a crucible :muscle: ? How often do you push yourself? I am really proud of everyone here. Everybody is working really hard. I mean we are working through each error, bug and headache, just slaving through this code. I am waking up a little bit now after the nap. I am ready for another 12 hours. The team is giving me energy. Every team appears to have got caught on some problem. We all need to take a break collectively. I've been stuck for a like 2 hours now. I just had to step away. I think the web team just made a break through. They solved a problem they've been stuck on some time now, cool.

#ACT III
##12:00 - 17:59

Wow, 6 hours to go. We came a long way. We are at the final frontier. The mobile client is uploading exif data to firebase and now we just have to pull it down and plot it on a map. Phew! We are just putting our heads down and finishing up. Lets do it.

#ACT IV
##18:00 - 23:59

We started celebrating because we actually finished at the tail end of ACT III. It was amazing because everyone gathered around together to get over the last hurdle. So I guess for ACT IV we just partied and celebrated. We popped a bottle of champagne and ate dinner. Most people stayed and hung out afterwards. We cleaned up and headed out. I just want to say I am very proud of everyone and great job.
